- **Description:** This notebook implements real-time emotion recognition using a CNN and live webcam feed. It covers loading a pre-trained model, processing video frames, and classifying facial expressions into seven emotions, with a focus on efficient, dynamic emotion detection and visualization.

### 2. Image Classification
- **File:** `cnn_image_classification.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook showcases image classification with CNNs using the CIFAR-10 dataset, covering data preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation.

### 3. Fashion MNIST Image Classification
- **File:** `cnn_fashion_mnist_classification.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook delves into image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the Fashion MNIST dataset, emphasizing data preprocessing, model architecture, and performance evaluation to accurately classify different types of clothing items.

### 4. Real-Time Object Detection
- **File:** `cnn_real_time_object_detection.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook implements real-time object detection using YOLOv4 with OpenCV. It covers model integration, video stream processing, and object classification, providing a hands-on approach to deploying deep learning models for live detection tasks.
