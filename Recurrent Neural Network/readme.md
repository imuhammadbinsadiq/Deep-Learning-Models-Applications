# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Projects

## Overview
Welcome to the "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Projects" repository! This collection of notebooks showcases the power of RNNs in tackling a variety of sequence-related tasks across different domains. Whether you're looking to perform sentiment analysis, forecast time series data, or predict sequences, this repository provides well-documented implementations and examples to help you get started.

## RNN Implementations

### 1. Sentiment Analysis
- **File:** `rnn_sentiment_analysis.ipynb`
- **Description:** Learn how to build and train an RNN model for sentiment analysis. This notebook walks you through preprocessing text data, designing an RNN architecture, and evaluating the model on a sentiment classification task.

### 2. Time Series Forecasting
- **File:** `rnn_time_series_forecasting.ipynb`
- **Description:** Explore the application of RNNs to time series forecasting. This notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation using real-world datasets, such as stock prices or weather data.

### 3. Sequence Prediction
- **File:** `rnn_sequence_prediction.ipynb`
- **Description:** Delve into sequence prediction tasks with RNNs, including text generation and next-step prediction in sequences. This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to building and evaluating RNN models for various sequence-based tasks.
